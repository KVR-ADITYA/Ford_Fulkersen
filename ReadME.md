# Ford Fulkesen for network flow

## List of Tasks
* __Task 1__: To implement the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
* __Task 2__: Implement the subroutine to find the minimum st-cut of a network flow graph
* __Task 3__: Using Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for solving Bipartite Matching problem
* __Task 4__: Run your algorithm on different kinds of network flow graph for tasks 1 and 3. Smaller graphs to
test your code and larger graphs to verify the robustness of implementations. Some of the bipartite graphs
can be found in Stanford repository
* __Task 5__: Record your experimental results along with the documentation of algorithm
