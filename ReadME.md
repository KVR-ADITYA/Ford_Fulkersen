# Ford Fulkesen for network flow

## List of Tasks
* Task 1: To implement the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
* Task 2: Implement the subroutine to find the minimum st-cut of a network flow graph
* Task 3: Using Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for solving Bipartite Matching problem
* Task 4: Run your algorithm on different kinds of network flow graph for tasks 1 and 3. Smaller graphs to
test your code and larger graphs to verify the robustness of implementations. Some of the bipartite graphs
can be found in Stanford repository
* Task 5: Record your experimental results along with the documentation of algorithm

This is an implementation of the famous for-fulkersen algorithm for finding the maximum flow in a network
